(CLASSIC) JAVA ELEMENTS
=======================


- [ ] Polymorphism vs overloading
  - [ ] Compilation / Runtime (execution)
  - [ ] Static / Dynamic

- [ ] var is not dynamic typing

- [ ] Inheritance vs composition
  - [ ] extends vs implements
  - [ ] Constructor chaining

- [ ] Nested classes
  - [ ] inner (non-static)
    - [ ] qualified this
  - [ ] static nested

- [ ] Generics
  - [ ] Bounds and wildcards
    - [ ] Compare to arrays
  - [ ] Erasure
    - [ ] Reifiable / Non-reifiable types
      - cannot create instance of type parameter
      - cannot create array of parameterized type
      - cannot use instanceof / cast with parameterized type
      - cannot overload with two different instantiations of the same parameterized type
  - [ ] Raw-types -> do not use them
  - [ ] With nested classes
  - [ ] F-bounded polymorphism
