(CLASSIC) JAVA ELEMENTS
=======================

- [x] Polymorphism vs overloading
  - [x] Compilation / Runtime (execution)
  - [x] Static / Dynamic

- [x] var is not dynamic typing

- [x] Inheritance vs composition
  - [x] extends vs implements
  - [x] Constructor chaining

- [x] Nested classes
  - [x] inner (non-static)
    - [x] qualified this
  - [x] static nested

- [ ] Generics
  - [x] Compare to arrays
  - [x] Erasure
  - [x] Reifiable / Non-reifiable types
    - cannot create instance of type parameter
    - cannot create array of parameterized type
    - cannot use instanceof / cast with parameterized type
    - cannot overload with two different instantiations of the same parameterized type
  - [x] Raw-types -> do not use them
  - [x] With nested classes
  - [ ] Bounds and wildcards
  - [ ] F-bounded polymorphism
